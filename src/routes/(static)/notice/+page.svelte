  <div>Dear Coinos users,</div>

  <div>I'm planning to retire and shut down Coinos in the Fall.</div>

  <div>
    Custodying people's money is a huge responsibility and I don't feel
    adequately equipped to continue giving it the attention it deserves. At this
    stage of my life, I want to spend more time with family and work on other
    projects.
  </div>

  <div>
    Coinos has suffered a series of security breaches and system failures over
    the last few months. I've been trying to deal with them but it hasn't been
    fun and it's hard to be confident that I've covered all my bases.
  </div>

  <div>
    I also worry that I might face regulatory compliance issues if I continue
    providing payment services in Canada under Carney.
  </div>

  <div>
    Our user base and payment volume have been steadily increasing over the
    years and some people are storing a non-trivial amount of money in their
    accounts. The stakes are getting higher.
  </div>

  <div>
    I'm really sorry to let down all those who use Coinos regularly, who have
    promoted it to their friends and communities and have integrated it into
    their own projects and had plans to grow with us into the future.
  </div>

  <div>
    I intend to keep the service online for some time to give people a chance to
    withdraw their funds and transition to other solutions. I'm committed to
    ensuring that everyone gets their money back.
  </div>

  <div>
    If you encounter problems or notice any unauthorized withdrawals or changes
    to your account, please email <a href="mailto:support@coinos.io"
      >support@coinos.io</a
    > right away.
  </div>

  <div>
    We are solvent but the amount of funds available for withdrawal from the
    server will be limited each day to give me time to react to incidents. If
    you have trouble withdrawing, please wait a few hours or up to a day and try
    again.
  </div>

  <div>
    Thanks to all of you who used Coinos over the years and supported us. I
    intend to stay involved in the community and continue promoting Bitcoin
    adoption.
  </div>

  <div>Sincerely,</div>

  <div>
